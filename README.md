Step 1: Create Your HTML Site
Prepare your website files:

Create a directory on your local machine for your project (e.g., my-html-site).
Inside that directory, create an index.html file and any other assets (CSS, JS, images) your site requires.
Write your HTML content:

Develop a simple HTML page or use a template.
You can add styling with CSS and functionality with JavaScript as needed.
Step 2: Write a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile:
In the root of your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile without any extension.
Edit the Dockerfile:
Use a lightweight base image like nginx:alpine since Nginx is a popular choice for serving static content.
Copy your website files into the container.
Ensure Nginx runs in the foreground (as explained in a previous response).
Here's an example Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official nginx image as a parent image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the static website files into the container
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# Tell Docker to use port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx and keep it running in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container
Build your Docker image:

Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to build your Docker image:
css
Copy code
docker build -t my-html-site .
Run your Docker container:

After the build completes, start your container:
css
Copy code
docker run --name my-website -d -p 8080:80 my-html-site
The -p flag maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container (Nginx default).
Visit your site:

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
You should see your static HTML site served by the Docker container.
